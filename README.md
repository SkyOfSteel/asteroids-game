# Asteroids

My own little clone of the [immortal classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)), written in Python with the help of Pygame.

# Usage

**`uv run main.py`**

The program is designed to run in a [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) environment pinned to Python 3.13.

# Controls

*W* - move forward.
*S* - move backward.
*A* - rotate left.
*S* - rotate right.
*Spacebar* - shoot.

# To-Do List and Ideas:

1. Score per asteroid shot and a persistent scoreboard.
2. "Game Over" screen and main menu.
3. Music and animated background.
4. Textures for the asteroids and player ship.
